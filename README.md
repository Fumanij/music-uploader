Music Uploader is a Node.js SPA that allows users to upload, download and play their own songs. This site is currently live on https://sheltered-meadow-20717.herokuapp.com.

Different browsers support varying audio file types. Data is currently stored in a universal database via mLabs (using MongoDB and Amazon S3 Bucket). 

This application uses Node.js, Express and Mongo for backend, and EJS as the template engine.

## Get Started

To test it out, first download files and within the CLI enter ```npm install``` when you're in the current directory to download all required dependencies, then run on ```localhost:5000```.
