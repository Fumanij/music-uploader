Different browsers support varying audio file types. Data is currently stored in a universal database via mLabs (using MongoDB and Amazon S3 Bucket). 

This application uses Node.js, Express and Mongo for backend, and EJS as the template engine.

To test it out, first download files and within the CLI enter ```npm install``` to download all required dependencies, then run on ```localhost:5000```.
